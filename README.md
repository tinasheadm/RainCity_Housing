# RainCity Housing Evaluation Project 

## Fully functical scripts written in Pyhton using mathematical search functions for the prime factorization of a number, and implement Graph data structure.  

This project shows the implementation of function to achieve a few simple tasks. Every part of this project is sampe 
code which shows how to do the following:

### question 1
* Create a function, given and input ‘n’, a positive integer between 1 and Int64.MaxValue, that returns a list of prime numbers between 1 and n.

### question 2 - 4
* Implement a Graph data structure and create a function to find the shortest path between two nodes. 
* Implement a breadth first search.
* Implement a depth first search.

### question 5
* Implement a function that searches for the prime factorization of a number, ‘n’, between 1 and Int64.MaxValue.

## User Instructions on how to run these scripts

One of the ways to run these scripts is through Visual Studio OR Visual Studio Code. You can install the application by following instructions on this page
"https://code.visualstudio.com/download"

 I prefer to use Jupyter for a few reasons. I am able to run the code in chunks which will be familiar to R Studio users. 
 Jupyter goes beyond its use as a stand-alone tool, it’s also integrated with a number of platforms. Anaconda is a prepackaged distribution of Python 
 which contains a number of Python modules and packages, including Jupyter.
 
 To run Jupyter in VS code you can follow the step by step instructions by using the link below :
